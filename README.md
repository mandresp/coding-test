# Coding Test

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a website that will ask you questions and display your highscore with an initial at the end.

## Installation

Open the link in a browser.

## Usage

The website will display a start button and the high scores in your local storage. Once you press the start button it will prompt you with a random first question. Make your selection and it will tell you if you were correct or not. Once you have answered all of the question answers it will prompt you to input your initials and it should record them to the high scores list but I was only able to add the high score.
